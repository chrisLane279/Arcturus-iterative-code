# Arcturus-iterative-code
 Code for a cRIO based robot called "Arcturus".

Arcturus is a rebuilt FRC robot chassis with a drivetrain and no other actual subsystems (for now).
It utilizes a National Instruments compact RIO as its robot controller. The controller in arcturus is a NI cRIO-FRC II, however a model NI cRIO-FRC (NI cRIO-FRC I) or a NI cRIO-9075 will also accept the same code with slight modification.

In order to use this code and deploy it to a robot, you will need the Netbeans IDE and the 2014 FRC plugins avalible on the official FIRST website.
